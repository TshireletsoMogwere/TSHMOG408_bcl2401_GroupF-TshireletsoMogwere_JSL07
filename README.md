# Learning Experience README

## Introduction
   This README contains my learning experience in executing Javascript when the DOM content has been fully loaded and parsed.

## Goals
   - To understand the concept of DOMcontentLoaded event in Javascript.
   - To learn how to dynamically manipulate HTML elements using Javascript.
   - Learn how to dynamically hide content on the webpage.

## Resources 
   - Used chatgpt to breifly explain the hide modal code.
   - Documentation on DOMContentLoaded event.

## Learning Process
   I had to begin by researching the first event listener in the code as I wanted to further understand the DOMContentLoaded event and its significance in Javascript programming. I then continued to search why the hiding code should be written as "model.style.display = 'none' " as it was the first time coming across a code like that.

## Achievements 
  - Developed a Javascript script that dynamically generates a certificate based on user script.
  - Generated a model display for the certificate to be shown on a modal window.
  - Added an event listener for the closing button on the modal display.

## Challenges Faced
   - I struggled with fully understanding the DOMContentLoaded event and its timing.
   - My logo image appeared to be small but it was a quick fix.

## Conclusion
   My learning experience was great becaused I handled the errors and coded without having to ask for clarification from peers or online platforms. My research was strictly for understanding some terms but I was proud that I could do something on my own and I gained a better understanding in executing Javascript when the DOM content has completely loaded and parsed.
